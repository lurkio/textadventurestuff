"And just what do you think you're doing? Eh? Come on! Answer me", shouts the King of Xaan, angrily. 
"Water. . . Water", you cry, feebly, and gaze up at the King. 
"Stealing my water, were you, dog! You know what I do to thieves, don't you? I lock them in my keep for a while", laughs the King, evilly. 
"How long a while? I'm very thirsty", you croak, touching your cracked lips. 
"I'm not sure", replies the King, "Until you rot, probably", and he orders for you to be cast into prison! 
So begin your adventures on the Island of Xaan. . .

Message 92: You sing the latest number by the famous heavy metal group, Uranium Thunderbolt, very loudly. 
Message 93: You sing a beautiful lullaby about skipping through a meadow, gathering flowers. The world seems a better place.

Message 131: The sand is dry and the hole quickly fills in.

Message 133: With the dark glasses on, the mist totally obscures your vision. You trip and are concussed as you hit the floor. When you wake, you find yourself at the foot of the hill, your possessions gone! 
Message 134: God helps those who help themselves! 
Message 135: "I recognise

Message 145: You be the desperate criminal from the prison cells, yonder! You'll not come aboard my ship", shouts the Captain, and ties your neck into various sailor's knots! 
Message 146: "Hello there, stranger! You'll be wantin' passage on my vessel, will 'e? Drop your treasure down there, for payment, like", 
Message 147: says the Captain. 
Message 148: "Up your poop deck, matey! I want more treasure", 
Message 149: "Shiver me timbers! That'll do nicely, sir", 
Message 150: Press<&return&<for another game.

Message 152: some food 
Message 153: a bar of soap 
Message 154: a blanket 
Message 155: down there for me", says the beggar. 
Message 156: "Hi! I've had a wash", says the beggar, waving the soap. 
Message 157: An object falls to the floor! 
Message 158: "Because you've been so nice to me, have these mittens", says the beggar, generously. 
Message 159: The building resounds with a low pitched hum as the massive door slowly opens, revealing, as it does so, the dimly lit interior of the tower! 
Message 160: Well done! You have completed "Island of Xaan" and have a maximum score of 250 points! 
Message 161: s! 
Message 162: "Hello there, strangThe tremendous power of the waterfall forces you to your knees and you collapse, breathlessly, to the floor! You glance northwards and make out the hazy shape of a cavern entrance beyond. Then everything goes black. 
Message 163: You are under the crashing waterfall, the open umbrella held safely above you. The white water rushes past, its spray soaking you to the skin. Through the wet haze, to the north, you see the entrance to a dark cavern. 
Message 164: You are in a small, dimly lit prison cell, filled with the stench of death and decay. The smooth, granite walls seem to close in on you, windowless and menacing! To the north looms a huge, iron door. 
Message 165: You are at a dead end in the corridor. The prison cells south of you give way to rough, brick walls, and the ceiling is so low, that you are forced to stoop. 
Message 166: You are in a long, east-west corridor. Either side of you, locked prison cells stretch into the gloom. 
Message 167: You are at the western end of the long corridor. South of you are the last of the locked prison cells. A narrow archway is just visible amongst the shadows of the north wall. 
Message 168: You are in a twisting maze of echoing corridors. Each sound you make seems amplified as it bounces between the cold, rock walls! 
Message 169: You are in the guard room of the keep. Light streams in from an open doorway to the north, reaching every corner, showing the filth and squalor that abounds! A scruffy guard is sleeping on a hard, wooden bench set into the north wall. 
Message 170: You are on a hilltop north of the keep, looking down a dangerous scree slope to a dark forest beyond. 
Message 171: You are on the hilltop northwest of the keep. To the north, down the hill, the dark forest spreads across a valley. 
Message 172: You are on the hilltop northeast of the keep. North, down the hill, is the forest. 
Message 173: You are on a cobbled pathway leading southwest to northeast down the hill. 
Message 174: You are on a cobbled pathway which leads southeast to northwest down the hill. 
Message 175: You are in a trench west of the keep. High walls tower either side of you, shrouding you in a deep, cold shadow. 
Message 176: You are in a high walled gully east of the keep. The walls have been worn smooth over the generations and are unsurmountable. 
Message 177: You are in a walled trench west of the keep. A chill breeze reddens your face. 
Message 178: You are in a walled gully east of the keep. A sharp breeze whistles up the gully from the south. 
Message 179: You are on a clifftop southwest of the keep. The strong wind lashes the sea into a turmoil, sending surf up the jagged cliff-face. 
Message 180: You are on a narrow ledge south of the keep, high above the raging sea. The wind blows hard and forces you back against the keep wall, away from the debris thrown up by the wash as it crashes into the sheer cliff. 
Message 181: You are southeast of the keep, on a pinnacle overlooking the sea. The swirling wind howls around you, biting your flesh and freezing your breath! 
Message 182: You are on a plain overlooking a ramshackle graveyard. The wind picks up fine dust which covers you from head to toe, and makes you seem ghostly white. 
Message 183: You are high above a windswept plain, looking down from a rocky precipice. The strong wind rushes past you, through a low archway to the north, and into the musty caverns. 
Message 184: You are on a precipice far above a pebble beach. The blustery wind swirls around you, causing you to teeter precariously on the edge! 
Message 185: You are on a gusty clifftop looking out across the sea. Far below you is a wooden jetty, west of which is moored a sailing ship. 
Message 186: You are on a pebble beach at the foot of a steep cliff. A salty breeze blows in from the sea. 
Message 187: You are on a pebble beach, under a high cliff, next to the rough sea. The wind is strong. 
Message 188: You are on a treeless path at the foot of a high mountain. Staring up, its steep walls seem to disappear into the cloudy sky. 
Message 189: You at the bottom of a tall, stark mountain. To the north, there is a crevice in the side of the mountain, large enough to enter. 
Message 190: You are at the entrance to a massive forest. East and west of you grows a thorny hedgerow, which forms a path into the forest and then veers right and left, closing in the trees. It is light here, but peering in, all is an eerie blackness! 
Message 191: You are at the edge of the forest, your way out blocked by a thick hedge. 
Message 192: You are at the forest's edge. In the hedgerow forming the eastern boundary is a hole, just wide enough for you to squeeze through. 
Message 193: You are deep in the forest. Tall trees rear up all around, their branches intertwining to cut out all daylight. Your lamp casts a yellow halo over you, which scares the forest creatures and holds them at bay. 
Message 194: You are in the entrance chamber of a large cave system. South of you, the cascading waterfall obscures your view of the forest. 
Message 195: You are at a dead end in the cavern passages. You lamp casts strange, animated shadows on the uneven walls. 
Message 196: You are in a maze of narrow cavern passages, mindful of the rocky outcrops and pointed stalactites which hang dangerously from the ceiling. 
Message 197: You are in a large chamber, aware of the cold draught which touches your face from the north. 
Message 198: You are in a blustery cavern passage. A breeze blows in from the south. 
Message 199: You are in a massive hall in the caverns. The sound of dripping water echoes from somewhere distant and emerging from the shadows of the ceiling you see huge, conical stalactites, lime white in the glare of your lamp. 
Message 200: You are at the top of a winding staircase, hewn from the cavern rock. 
Message 201: You are on a winding staircase, carved from the cavern rock. 
Message 202: You are in a dimly lit graveyard. Swirling mists cloak the headstones, making them shimmer with an unnatural light. 
Message 203: You are on a misty flight of steps which connects upper and lower levels of the graveyard. 
Message 204: You are on dry, sandy beach. In the distance to the north, the rough sea crashes to the shore. A little way south, the grey cliffs wall in the beach. 
Message 205: You are on a sandy beach by the rough sea. The sand is damp and you leave deep footprints. 
Message 206: You are on a wide, flat plain. The wind blows strongly, kicking up the dust into choking clouds. 
Message 207: You are on the top of a dangerous scree slope overlooking the forest. You gaze down the hill, to the bottom of the slope where the ground seems firmer. At that moment, a stone moves from under you, and you sprawl across the jagged stones. 
Message 208: You enter the dilapidated house and peer round, cautiously. You hear a loud scraping and then collapse to the floor, as the roof caves in and crushes you. 
Message 209: You enter the room and find yourself in a study. A leather swivel chair faces away from you. Suddenly, the chair revolves and you face the King. "I don't want to be disturbed", he shouts, and grabbing a silver letter opener, stabs you! 
Message 210: You plunge into the freezing sea. A gigantic wave floods over you, pulling you under. The last thing you feel is the sting of salt water in your eyes. 
Message 211: You are outside the Tower of Xaan. Its curved walls are smooth and high, and loom, imposingly, over the island. The west wall is taken up by an arched, wooden door, which is studded with black iron and painted with the King's coat of arms. 
Message 212: You are in the main hall of the tower. Tapestries depicting the King of Xaan's evil reign, hang from the grey, stone walls. To the east is the arched door leading out. 
Message 213: You are in a wide corridor in the tower. A small door lies partially hidden at the bottom of some steps. 
Message 214: You are in the wide corridor, brightly lit from above by a strange light-source you cannot understand. 
Message 215: You are at the end of the wide corridor. A flight of stairs leads to the floor above, and a small door is set in the north wall. 
Message 216: You are in a well furnished sitting room, double glazed, with fashionable bamboo chairs and an electric fire with plastic coal. 
Message 217: You are in a large, bright kitchen. White, enamel tiles cover the walls and concrete steps lead up to a small, painted door. 
Message 218: You are in a utility room. Various complex machines, with names that all end in "omatic", buzz, clank and hum impressively. After gazing at the "Digital washomatic stereo radio drinks machine", you decide it has no adventure significance. 
Message 219: You are in a spacious pantry with wood-panelled walls. A varnished, pine table is located in the centre of the room and occupies much of the floor area. 
Message 220: You are on the lower landing. Stairs lead to the floors above and below. 
Message 221: You are in a passageway on the first floor. The south wall has exits to various rooms. 
Message 222: You are at the end of the passageway on the first floor. 
Message 223: You are on the upper landing. Steps lead down to the floor below. Further along the landing to the east, you make out the shape of a small door. 
Message 224: You are at the far end of the upper landing outside a small, wooden door. A message on the door reads "&private keep out&". 
Message 225: You are in a disused bedroom, dusty and bare. Your footsteps resonate on the floorboards. To the south there is a cupboard door. 
Message 226: You are in a child's bedroom. The walls are brightly decorated with pictures of teddy bears and a small bed is pushed against the east wall. A red glossy door marked "Toy Cupboard" takes up the south wall. 
Message 227: You are in the master bedroom. It is spacious and well lit. An elegant four poster bed is positioned next to a door in the south wall. 
Message 228: You are in a large, dimly lit, walk-in linen cupboard. A grimy door occupies the north wall. 
Message 229: You are in a small toy cupboard, dimly illuminated by the light which creeps in through gaps under the door to the north. 
Message 230: You are in a modern bathroom. The suite is an exclusive chocolate colour, sunk into the floor, with engraved taps, a thermal towel rail and some rather expensive Pseudo-Victorian soap dishes! 
Message 231: You are at the top of a flight of steps, carved out of the mountain. There is a fresh breeze which seems to enliven you! 
Message 232: You are on a flight of earthy steps, carved out of the mountain. 
Message 233: You are at the bottom of a flight of steps, excavated from the mountainside. 
Message 234: You are on a spiral pathway on the side of the mountain. 
Message 235: You are at a plateau half way up the mountain. A peculiar, blue light pulses to the west. 
Message 236: You are at the eastern edge of the plateau. High banks of earth stop any further progress. Far to the west you see a pulsing, blue light. 
Message 237: You are at a small grotto, cut into the mountain. A blue, neon sign reading: "<Make Your Wish Here<", points to a small well, constructed of brick, with a brass plate set into the wall. 
Message 238: You are in a barren mountain pass, squeezed between two banks of earth and rock. The ground is hard and uneven. 
Message 239: You are on a grassy slope leading down the mountain. The vegetation is rich and green. 
Message 240: You are on a grassy plateau overshadowed by the mighty Tower of Xaan. There are signs that others have been here before you! 
Message 241: You are at the bottom of a grassy slope. The grass here is weak, yellow and intermingled with bare patches. 
Message 242: You are on the flat lands beneath the Tower of Xaan. The lands are sparsely vegetated and stony. 
Message 243: You are in the midst of the flat lands beneath the Tower of Xaan. The ground is hard and rocky, and no vegetation grows. 
Message 244: You are in a stinking ditch. The hard floor is covered with pools of stagnant liquid and stenching slime. The sickening smell lingers, disgustingly, in your nostrils. This isn't a good place to picnic! 
Message 245: You are at the end of a dusty road, bounded by drainage ditches. To the north lie the flat lands beneath the Tower of Xaan. 
Message 246: You are on a long, dusty road. Overgrown paths lead north, to a row of condemned houses. Their woodwork is rotting, their paintwork chipped and flaking, and their windows smashed or boarded. 
Message 247: You are at the start of a long, straight road, surfaced with red dust. The road is bounded by shoulder-high ditches, cut for drainage purposes. 
Message 248: You are at the bottom of the hill. High above and south, the keep towers over you, seeming to watch your every move! The dark forest is to the north, while roads stretch east and west. 
Message 249: You are in a narrow, shady lane. Wild flowers and grasses flourish between bare cart-tracks. 
Message 250: You are at the end of the shady lane. The flowers and grasses grow tall, here. A disused track is visible to the north. 
Message 251: You are on a disused track. The undergrowth is thick and full of thorny plants and nettles, guaranteed to rip and sting. 
Message 252: You are on a narrow stairway which leads up to the windy plain, and down to the misty graveyard. 
Message 253: You are in a beggar's hovel: a tiny wooden shack, with rotting floorboards and damp walls. A beggar sits in the corner, crosslegged, and humming tunelessly. 
Message 254: You are on a wooden gangplank to the ship. A red-nosed Captain, with a false leg and a stuffed parrot nailed to his plywood shoulder, swigs a bottle of rum, and peers at you. 
Message 255: You board the vast sailing ship, followed by the Captain. The anchor is lifted, the wind catches in the sails and they billow out. Slowly, the ship leaves the Island of Xaan! You have escaped! You are free at last! 
Message 256: You are at a clearing in the forest. A waterfall cascades down the steep mountain wall, roaring with power! A rainbow arcs through the spray above. The waters disappear into a crevice, forming underground rivers and streams. 
Message 257: You are at the bottom of a winding staircase looking out onto a pebble beach. 
Message 258: You are on a pebble beach at the entrance to a system of caves. In the dim light of the interior, steps are visible, climbing up the inner rock walls. 
Message 259: You are on a stony scree slope. The ground is firm and safe here, but further up the hill there are loose rocks and hidden pitfalls. Below you, the dark forest covers the valley. 
Message 260: You are on a long wooden jetty, either side of which, are white, steel railings. The jetty stretches out over the sea. 
Message 261: You are in the sparsely vegetated flat lands. To the north, the Tower of Xaan reaches into the sky. West of you is a small, wooden shack, its roof broken and its door hanging loosely from rusty hinges. A strange humming emanates from within. 
Message 262: You are on a vast, windswept plain, east of the forest boundary. Dust devils swirl and dart about the landscape, showering you with a fine, white powder. Frail trees, too small to climb, arc their bare limbs to the ground. 
Message 263: You are on a plain: wide, flat and windswept. To the west is a narrow crawlway leading into the dark forest. The gales uproot dry, brittle plants and blow them across the land. 
Message 264:
